        <h1>The Deep</h1>
        <p>Amazon's new superhero satire, The Boys, has taken the superhero show to a new level - and its most interesting character is The Deep, a phenomenally complex Aquaman spoof. The Boys - an adaptation of the Garth Ennis comic of the same name - twists the superhero formula to show how heroes would become corporate celebrities, and focuses on a group of humans who hate them for what they have suffered at their hands. Add to this multiple conspiracies - one by Vought (the corporation that controls the supes) to create heroes, and another by Homelander to create supervillains - it's no wonder that The Boys has become one of Amazon's most-watched series</p>
